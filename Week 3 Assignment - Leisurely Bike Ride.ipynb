    "There are 1,519 miles between New York City and Key West according to Google Maps. This is 124 hours of biking and ferries being taken. If we assume that we bike 8 hours a day then it'll take approximately 16 days to get there. This means our series shall have 16 entries. Ideally we would ride at the same speed and the same amount of miles per day which we would get by dividing 1519 and 16 (95). However, realistically there would be some variation every day. We can generate this variation by making 16 random numbers ourselves from 70-130 and then multiplying each number by the 1519 miles we need over the sum of all the random numbers:"
